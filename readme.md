# Algorithm and Programming - Final Project : Mine Sweeper

Minesweeper is a logic-based single-player computer game played on a rectangular board. The objective is to find a specified number of randomly placed "mines" in the shortest possible time by clicking on "safe" squares while using squares and avoid mines. The game ends when the player clicks on a mine.

Different levels have different grids with timer on the left, the number of mines that haven't been found and the menu button that asks whether the player wants to start a new game or not.

This is an example of how the Beginner level looks like. It has a 10x10 grid (total of 100 boxes) with 15 mines
